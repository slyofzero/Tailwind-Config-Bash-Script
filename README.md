# Tailwind-Config-Bash-Script

This is just a bash script that creates a react app for you with TailwindCSS and PostCSS pre-configured.

I regret not making a git repository for this project early on. It has happened so many times that one update broke the whole code...I truly wish I had made a git repo back when I started this.
